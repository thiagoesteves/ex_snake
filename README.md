# Game webserver written in Elixir + Phoenix Liveview

![Erlgame](/docs/ex_snake.png)

The app has the same core game written in [Erlang](https://github.com/thiagoesteves/erlgame) and  [Elixir](https://github.com/thiagoesteves/elisnake) but it is using phoenix as webserver and liveview to connect the templates with the server. It is part of the liveview studies.

# Compile and run the application

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
